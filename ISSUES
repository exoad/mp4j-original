            Additional Notes:

In this PR format, you can also correct this along with your own potential fix, however this should
be done with a notice in the additional notes section of your issue!

If your PR has any form deletions to the original source material, it would deemed needed for revisions.
Revisions of other issues will be only followed for the following reasons:
1. Spelling / Grammatical Issues
2. Incorrect mentions (package paths, file paths)

Notice: The FEATURES document has a much less open policy for new features, however you are still free
        to alter it as you want to fit your own needs.

I only do this because I rarely use Git provideds as a main way to look at my code and only as a way to spread my project.
