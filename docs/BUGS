Here are a list of bugs or unwanted behaviors throughout the program itself (not external links):

[*] #3 "WaveForm animation not acting when frequency too low, and too extreme when frequency too high"
  Reproduction: Play a low frequency audio file and a loud file with a high frequency intensity
  Detailed Description: The waveform under a hardcoded number is unable to determine if the frequency is low and what
                        to do. This action prevents any form of alteration in order to correct the animation so that it
                        will always show up and not be hidden.
  Potential Fix: Calculate the average sum per frame and analyze a certain threshold and apply the threshold average for
                 each vertical line.
  Status: Not started

[***] #2 "ProgressSlider stopping seconds or is misaligned after the music stops"
  Reproduction: Run an audio track until the end
  Detailed Description: The progress slider does not go all the way to the end of the avaliable space once the audio
                        track is reaching the end of the playtime
  Extra Notes: It is noted that it is most often 1 second late, however if tied in with [BUG #1] it is noted that
               there can be much more delay and misalignment.
  Status: Not Started

[***] #1 "ProgressSlider resetting to the wrong spot when audio resumed"
  Reproduction: Literally as the title says
  Detailed Description: The progress slider resumes to the start (0) when the time is resumed thus making
                        it very hard to know where you are once you start.
  Status: Fixing?
