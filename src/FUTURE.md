# The Future for this project

This project as you notice is quit different with the following dirs:

`old` <br>
`project`<br>

## OLD - legacy code
The `old` directory signifies the original music_player that was made in the quarter of fall 2021 to march 2022. It sparked the major breakthroughs in my understanding
of the different audio formats and my knowledge of Java. However, one of the achilles heel of this project back then was the fact that it contained a class hierarchy 
that became increasingly more and more diffcult to refactor on an automated scale to the point that I had to do much (90%) of the refactoring myself. This was all 
caused by my previous in-experience with the verbosity of the Java-language and the lack of packages that did not need a package manager (Maven, Gradle, etc.). Even 
though the application was brightly lit, behind that GUI lies unexpainable masses of unnecessary synchronizations, threads, and dead code. It contributed heavily to 
the CPU usage, even with this I was driven on by the need to add more and more features to *improve* it, while also trying to keep these defuncts and bugs in my 
planner. Well you would know how that went...really badly (and even that would be understatement). The massive amount of packages depreciation and package necessity 
increased as I needed more third-party packages to assist me with the crappy GUI work of Java-Swing. As time went on for another month or so, I lost in interest, not 
because I moved on, but of other reasons in my life, I just never got back to it as much for around 3 months. After this the project has become non-functional with me 
having altered the build of the JDK for this project a lot to suit the needs of other programs I wrote in Java. As this came to light, I realised this project needed
a face-lift and a refactor so this came the deprecation of the original.

## PROJECT - new code
This planned and hopes to abolish and restart this project with many new things that will come later and of course a better GUI ;)<br>
-Extended API<br>
-Better GUI<br>
-Quality for stereo<br>
-Audio Converter?<br>
-Less Cancerous Source Code<br>
-Native Interface Support (API C++)<br>
